- add categories for AudioOutput volume controls, so that a user doesn't have to
  control amaroK, JuK but media player, not knotify but Notification sounds, not
  Kopete or KPhone but communication
  => these categories can also become more usefull for an application that
     controls the volumes automatically, like turning down the music when a call
     comes in, or turning down the notifications when the media player knows
     it's playing classical music.
