- Add MIME types to the backends desktop file that give the types the backend
  can support in the best case. Those can then be used in places where the
  backend is only conditionally loaded if it can decode the MIME type at hand.
  Examples:
     o KFileAudioPreview asks audio/mp3 supported? Backend desktop file
       says yes, backend is loaded, backend says no (decoder not installed).
     o KFileAudioPreview asks application/pdf supported? Backend desktop file
       says no -> no backend loaded
