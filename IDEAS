- central config:
  1. Phonon created widgets:
    Selection of default audio/video playback/capture devices for
    Phonon::Cateogry
  2. Backend specific widgets:
    The backend should be able to provide a widget to configure important
    settings that cannot be set using above widgets.

- on hotplug of a USB audio/video device:
  1. If the device is plugged in for the first time
    Check whether the backend now provides new device selections. If yes, open
    up central config with the page that allows selection of the default
    devices. Tell the user what new options are available.
    Allow the user to set preference of devices: If device USB-Headset is
    available use that, else use builtin speakers.
  2. If the device has been configured before
    Show a passive popup if the default device has changed because the new
    device has higher preference.
