     * loud thinking about async parts of this interface
     *                     =============================
     *
     * Let us go over all the methods to make sure we will not get in trouble
     * (i.e. deadlocks or necessary processEvents calls)
     *
     * The following functions are safe because they don't have anything to do
     * with the stream data
     * - stop
     * - pause
     * - state
     * - currentTime
     * - videoPaths/audioPaths
     * - streamSize/setStreamSize
     * - tickInterval/setTickInterval
     * - streamSeekable/setStreamSeekable
     * - aboutToFinishTime/setAboutToFinishTime
     * - selectAudioStream/selectVideoStream/selectSubtitleStream
     * - selectedAudioStream/selectedVideoStream/selectedSubtitleStream
     *
     * - metaDataKeys/metaDataItem/metaDataItems
     *   Safe because the meta data is sent to the frontend async (calls don't
     *   call any functions on the backend object)
     *
     * - addVideoPath/addAudioPath
     *   flow graph setup calls, sometimes depend on stream data:
     *   With xine you need to create a new xine_stream which might need to do
     *   seeks and reads. In this case the backend should go into LoadingState
     *   or BufferingState (or ErrorState if the stream is not seekable).
     *
     * - hasVideo
     * - isSeekable
     * - availableAudioStreams/availableVideoStreams/availableSubtitleStreams
     *   Needs the stream data to know the "correct answer".
     *   Returns false if not enough data has been sent. TODO: might need a
     *   Q_SIGNAL to make it work async.
     *
     * - totalTime/remainingTime
     *   Needs the stream data to know the "correct answer".
     *   Returns -1 if not enough data has been sent. Has the length signal for
     *   async notification.
     *
     * - play
     * - seek
     *   if not enough data is available to start playback the backend goes into
     *   BufferingState
     */

    /**
     * \short Send media data to be decoded and played back.
     *
     * This class allows you to send arbitrary media data (well, any media data
     * format that the backend can decode) to the mediaframework used by the
     * backend. MediaObject uses the facilities of this class internally when
     * the mediaframework cannot handle an URL using KIO to fetch the data and
     * ByteStream to stream it to the backend.
     *
     * To use it you need to provide a constant (fast enough) datastream via
     * writeData. The signals needData and enoughData tell when the stream is
     * about to drop out or when the internal buffer is sufficently filled. The
     * backend should be able to buffer whatever you throw at it (of course,
     * depending on the available memory of the computer).
     *
     * This allows your data provider to use a push method (calling writeData
     * and waiting when enoughData is emitted) or a pull method (call writeData
     * whenever needData is emitted).
     *
     * If your datastream is seekable you can tell the ByteStream object via
     * setStreamSeekable. When a seek is called and the ByteStream needs data at
     * a different position it will tell you with the seekStream signal. This
     * signal passes the offset from the beginning of the datastream where the
     * next array of data passed to writeData should start from.
     *
     * When the datastream is complete written you need to call endOfData, else
     * ByteStream will not emit the finished signal, but go into the
     * BufferingState.
     *
     * As soon as you know the size of the stream (in bytes) you should call
     * setStreamSize. This could be useful for the ByteStream object to
     * correctly emit the aboutToFinish signal. If the size is not known the
     * aboutToFinish signal will still work, but you should not depend on it
     * being emitted at the correct time.
