/**
 * \brief The KDE Multimedia classes
 *
 * In this Namespace you find the classes to access Multimedia functions for
 * audio and video playback. Those classes are not dependent
 * on any specific framework (like they were in pre KDE4 times) but rather use
 * exchangeable backends to do the "dirty" work.
 *
 * If you want to write a new backend you also find the necessary classes in
 * Phonon::Ifaces.

 * For simple access to just playing an audio file see SimplePlayer.

 * \remarks
 * Extensions to the existing functionality can either be added by using the
 * reserved virtual functions in Backend or by adding a new interface e.g.
 * BackendV2 and creating a BackendV2 instance when the Backend instance is
 * created.
