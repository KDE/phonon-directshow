	 * \brief Central class for all Phonon backends.
	 *
	 * Exactly one instance of this class is created for the Phonon fronted
	 * class which utilizes it for Phonon::BackendCapabilities and to create all the
	 * other backend classes.
	 *
	 * \remarks
	 * If you need new factory-methods for the backend:
	 * - add a new Phonon::Ifaces::BackendV2 interface that inherits
	 *   Phonon::Ifaces::Backend and in Phonon::Factory check whether you can
	 *   qobject_cast<Phonon::Ifaces::BackendV2*>( d->backend ). If the cast succeeds
	 *   you have a backend that implements your new virtual functions.
	 * - simply add the new Phonon::Ifaces classes to libphononifaces and backends
	 *   can then implement those interfaces and instead of implementing
	 *   Ifaces::Backend implementing Ifaces::BackendV2.
