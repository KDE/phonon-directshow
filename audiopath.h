	 * For simple usage an instance of this class is added to a AbstractMediaProducer
	 * and an AbstractAudioOutput subclass (such as AudioOutput) added with
	 * addOutput.

	 * AudioPath* path = new AudioPath( this );
	 * mediaProducer->addAudioPath( path );

	 * It is best to add the path to a AbstractMediaProducer after construction and
	 * before calling any other methods.
