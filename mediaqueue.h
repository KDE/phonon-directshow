/**
 * \brief Class that queues playback of media with high precision (e.g. gapless
 * playback)
 *
 * Using a %MediaQueue object you can achieve high precision queuing of media
 * doing either a predefined pause between tracks, gapless playback, overlapping
 * playback or crossfades.
 *
 * In general you'll set up one %MediaQueue object and connect to the
 * \ref needNextUrl signal. When this signal is emitted you have to provide
 * the next URL calling \ref setNextUrl.
 * \code
 * m_mediaQueue = new MediaQueue(this);
 * m_mediaQueue->setUrl(m_playlist->nextUrl());
 * connect(m_mediaQueue, SIGNAL(needNextUrl()), SLOT(prepareNextUrl()));
 * \endcode
 *
 * The slot could look like this:
 * \code
 * void MyClass::prepareNextUrl()
 * {
 *   m_mediaQueue->setNextUrl(m_playlist->nextUrl());
 * }
 * \endcode
