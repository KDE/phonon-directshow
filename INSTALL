you need the kdelibs development package installed (at least 4.1 Beta1)
you need cmake version 2.4.5 or later
you need the libxine development package installed (> 1.1.9 but not the 1.2
versions)

to compile the backend do
% cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/kde4
% make

install it with
% make install

to make sure KDE4 picks up the new backend run
% kbuildsycoca4

Now all newly started applications should be using phonon-xine-tng already. You
can make sure in
% kcmshell4 kcm_phonon
in the Backend tab.


Please report problems to the Phonon module on http://bugs.kde.org/.
