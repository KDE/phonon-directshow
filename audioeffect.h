     * \short Audio effects that can be inserted into an AudioPath.
     * An audio effect is a special object which can perform
     * transformations on the specified AudioPath. Examples may include simple
     * modifiers such as fading or pitch shifting, or more complex mathematical
     * transformations.
     *
     * In order to use an effect, insert it into the path as follows:
     * \code
     * AudioPath *path = new AudioPath(this);
     * AudioEffect *effect = new AudioEffect(this);
     * path->insertEffect(effect);
     * \endcode
     *
     * The AudioEffect will immediately begin applying it's transformations on
     * the AudioPath. To stop it, remove the Effect from the AudioPath.
     *
     * \warning This class is not finished.
