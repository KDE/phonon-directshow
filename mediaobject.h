	 * This class is the most important class for most mediaplayback tasks. With

	 * information about the media data.
	 *
	 * A common usage example is the following:
	 * \code
	 * media = new MediaObject( this );
	 * connect( media, SIGNAL( finished() ), SLOT( slotFinished() );
	 * media->setUrl( "/home/username/music/filename.ogg" );
	 * media->play();
	 * \endcode
