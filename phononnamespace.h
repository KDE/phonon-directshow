 * In this Namespace you find the classes to access Multimedia functions for
 * audio and video playback. Those classes are not dependent
 * on any specific framework (like they were in pre KDE4 times) but rather use
 * exchangeable backends to do the work.
 *
 * If you want to write a new backend take a look at \ref phonon_backend_development_page.
