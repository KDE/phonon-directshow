	 * \short This class gives you the audio data (for visualizations).

	 * This class implements a special AbstractAudioOutput that gives your
	 * application the audio data. Don't expect realtime performance. But
	 * the latencies should be low enough to use the audio data for
	 * visualizations. You can also use the audio data for further processing
	 * (e.g. encoding and saving to a file).
	 *
	 * The class supports different data formats. One of the most common formats
	 * is to read vectors of integers (which will only use 16 Bit), but you can
	 * also request floats which some backends use internally.
