	 * effects are applied and what video channel (angle) is to be used.
	 *
	 * For simple usage an instance of this class is added to an AbstractMediaProducer
	 * and an AbstractAudioOutput subclass (such as AudioOutput) added with addOutput.

	 * VideoPath* path = new VideoPath( this );
	 * mediaProducer->addVideoPath( path );
	 * path->addOutput( videoOutput );
	 * @endcode

	 * It is best to add the path to an AbstractMediaProducer after
	 * construction, before calling any other methods.
